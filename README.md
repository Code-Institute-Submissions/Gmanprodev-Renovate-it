### Minimum Viable Product

All the User Stories have been assessed against value and complexity on the chart below. Due to the relatively short time for the implementation of the web app, only the MVPs will be implemented in the first release of the web app.

[User Stories evaluation](documentation/mvp/user_stories.md)


**Explanation of the chart**

* The top area of the chart has been given the higher priority of implementation because it represents the most important features including:
  * Colour scheme and design.
  * Simple to follow instructions
  * Intercative and showing real time feedback to the user.
  * Easy to use audio and timer function controls.
  * Allowing users to interact with the supplier.
  * Responsive Web app.
* I have addressed all of the high value and high/low complexity in the first release.
* The features with high complexity and low value have been postponed for future updates/releases.

### Design

#### Colors

Following colours have been used:
* ![#26a69a](https://place-hold.it/20/26a69a/000000?text=+) #26a69a (Teal) 
* ![#1d8882](https://place-hold.it/20/1d8882/000000?text=+) #1d8882 (Turquoise) 
* ![#f7e7ce](https://place-hold.it/20/f7e7ce/000000?text=+) #f7e7ce (Gin Fizz) 
* ![#000000](https://place-hold.it/20/000000/000000?text=+) #000000 (Black)    
* ![#F44336](https://place-hold.it/20/F44336/000000?text=+) #F44336 (Red) 
* ![#9e9e9e](https://place-hold.it/20/9e9e9e/000000?text=+) #9e9e9e (Nobel) 
* ![#fff](https://place-hold.it/20/fff/000000?text=+) #fff (White) 

I used the Materialize Teal colour across every page, including the navbar, footer, majority of the text and buttons. The homepage icons and the all of the forms use the color Gin Fizz. The color white is used for the navbar and footer content and flash messages. The delete buttons, both on the profile page and the confirmation modal, are red to emphasise the warning. Turquoise is used for the icon text on the homepage and Nobel (grey) is used for the form text. The colour black is used for a small amount of text on the tips cards and the forms.

#### Font

The Fonts I used for this project are **Yellowtail** and **Montserrat** with the font weights: 
* 300
* 400
* 500

The [Yellowtail](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yellowtail?query=yellow) font was chosen for it's brush stroke appearance to link in with the renovation theme.

### Wireframes

I decided that it would be more helpful to have mockups than simple wireframes. The mockups were built in [figma](https://www.figma.com/). 

Link to the mockups can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/fkOYNcpb1G4whUHj7TskjS/Renovate.IT?node-id=0%3A1). The mockups were designed for the mobile first approach. I have produced a desktop, tablet and mobile mockup of the main pages.

If you are unable to access the mockup links above please see the mockup images [here](https://github.com/Gmanprodev/Renovate-it/tree/master/documentation/wireframes).

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Elements seen on the homepage

* **Layout and Style**
    * I wanted the web app to have an appearance that was associated with industrial colours and style. My aim was to have a lot of white and grey to reflect the industrial theme but also to layer on top of that a artistic brush stroke style to soften the look and feel. I kept all of the content in a square format to refelct the blocks that are used in building material.
    * I installed Favicon scripts so that when the web app loads the user sees the R. logo next to the Renovate-it name at the top of the browser tab.

* **Navigation bar**
    * Has a `fixed` position to ensure that the logo can always be seen by the user.
    * A Renovate-it logo in the left corner which also serves as a link to the homepage. This logo moves to the centre of the navbar on smaller screens and links to the Profile page when a user is logged in.
    * The page links are displayed on the right of the navbar. These turn into a burger menu on smaller screens and reveal a side navbar which displays from the right.

* **Footer**
    * Logo displayed on the left of the footer.
    * Logo is linked to the homepage. When a user is logged in it links to the Profile page.
    * Social media links are on the right of the footer - facebook, Twitter and Instagram (linked to relevant login page).
    * All footer text and icons are displayed in the colour white and wobble when on `hover` and clicked.

* **First Parallax**
    * Displays a background image of grey brickwork. On top of the image sits text with two buttons, a welcome message with a Sign Up button and a login message with a login button. Both buttons have waves effects when on `hover` and clicked.

* **Parallax Divider**
    * This divides the top and bottom parallax. It displays four icons on one row and explains the user process. The icons and text gradually move down into one column as the screen get smaller.

* **Second Parallax**
    * Displays a background image of a modern kitchen. On top of the image sits text with a button linking to the public Top Tips page. The button has wave effects when on `hover` and clicked.

#### Elements seen on the 404 and 500 pages

* **Layout and Style**
    * A white page with both a header and button reflecting the same styling.
    * The button links to the Homepage.
    * The button has wave effects when on `hover` and clicked.

#### Elements seen on the Top Tips page

* **Search Bar**
    * A search bar displays at the top of the page. The user can enter any words and the function will search through all the tips stored in the database and return the results. If there are no results the user will see a flash message informing them that no results were found. Below the search bar there are two buttons, search and reset, the search button when clicked starts the function and the reset button restores the Top Tips page and displays all of the tips. Both buttons have waves effects when on `hover` and clicked.

* **Card Panels**
    * Each of the tips are displayed inside a card panel, each card panel has an image which is associated with the tip category and below the image the category, username, location and tip are displayed as text. The Top Tip info is line clamped at one line so that the card panels all remain the same height. At the bottom of each card panel there is a Read More button which, when clicked, displays a secondary pop up card with the full Top Tip text. The button has wave effects when on `hover` and clicked.

* **Back To The Top Button**
    * The button is placed at the bottom of the page to enable the user to return to the top of the page without manually scrolling. I haven't included any pagination because I wanted it to be an infinity scrolling page. The button is Gin Fizz colour and changes to White when on `hover` and clicked.

### Elements seen on the Login page

* **Login Form**
    * The form has a background colour of Gin Fizz, a username and password field and a Login button. The fields will display tooltips advising the user of any errors and the underline for each field will turn red if incorrect and turn green if correct. The Login button has a number of actions, depending on the users input, if the fields are blank "Please fill in", if the input is incorrect "incorrect password and/or username" and if all the inputs are correct it will take the user to their Profile page with a flash message "Welcome {username}. There is also a Sign Up button below the form in case the user isn't registered.

### Elements seen on the Signup page

* **Signup Form**
    * The form has a background colour of Gin Fizz, a username and password field and a Signup button. Below each field there is the text "*requirements", if the user `hover` or clicks on this text it will display a tooltip with the requirements for each field. The user will also see tooltips advising the them of any errors and the underline for each field will turn red if incorrect and turn green if correct. The Signup button has a number of actions, depending on the users input, if the fields are blank "Please fill in" and if all the inputs are correct it will take the user to their Profile page with a flash message "Welcome {username}.. There is also a Login button below the form in case the user is already registered.

### Elements seen on the Profile page

* **Tips added by user**
    * This page displays only the tips that have been added by the user that is logged in, at the bottom of each card panel is a Edit and Delete button. The Edit button links to the Edit page which has the same format as the Add Tips page, giving the user the ability to change any of the information held in the database. The delete button opens a modal which gives the user a secondary confirmation to delete or a close button to stop the delete action.
    
* **Back To The Top Button**
    * The button is placed at the bottom of the page to enable the user to return to the top of the page without manually scrolling. I haven't included any pagination because I wanted it to be an infinity scrolling page. The button is Gin Fizz colour and changes to White when on `hover` and clicked.

### Elements seen on the Edit page

* **Edit Form**
    * The form has a background colour of Gin Fizz, category, location and top tip fields are pre filled with the users original information which can be edited by the logged in user. Below the fields is a Save Changes button, upon clicking the button the changes are saved to the database and the user is redirected to their Profile page with a flash message "Tip Updated".

### Elements seen on the Add Tips page

* **Add Tip Form**
    * The form has a background colour of Gin Fizz with category, location and top tip fields. The category field is a dropdown selection and both the location and top tip fields are text. Below the fields is a Add Tip button, upon clicking the button the information is saved to the database and the user is redirected to their Profile page with a flash message "Tip Successfully Added".

### Logout Function

* **Logout**
    * Upon clicking the Logout link in the navbar the user is redirected to the Login page with a flash message "you are logged out".

### Features left to implement

* **Admin Account** - To allow an admin user to access all of the databse information for editing and deleting purposes.
* **Change Password** - To allow users to change their password.
* **Save Tips** - To enable users to save tips to a project list when logged in so that they can access particular tips rather than searching for them again.
* **Tracking User Behaviour** - Use an analytics tool such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) to view user behaviour.
* **Most and Least Visited Pages on the Site** - Use an analytics tool such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) to understand where the traffic is going on the site.


### Bugs and Fixes for Future Releases After Testing
 
* **Colour Contrasts** - The Lighthouse Audit Chrome extension highlighted that there are improvements needed on colour contrast, performance on the time it takes for the site to load and become interactive. These issues will be addressed in the next release.
* **Website Address in Footer** - The website address for SerenAppy does not currently exist and does not link to another page. This will be addressed in the next release.
* **Social Media Links in Footer** - The social media icons are linked to the correct pages, however these are currently generic login pages. These will direct you to the company specific pages in future releases.
* **Audio Quality** - Although the sound quality is pretty good the length of the audio files mean that there are too many stop and start points whilst the audio is playing. This leads to a disturbance for the user during their meditation sessions. These audio files will be updated in future releases.
* **Heade Size** - Reduce the size of the header (navbar) on smaller screen heights (laptops) so that more content can fit on the page - this will be implemented in future releases as the majority of users will be viewing the web app on a mobile device.
* **Background Images** - On big screen sizes the background image on the meditation pages becomes larger than the screen and some of the image is cut off. However this isn't very noticable and the images remain defined and clear - this will be implemented in future releases as the majority of users will be viewing the web app on a mobile device.
* **Confirmation Email** - Using emailjs to also send an email to the user to confirm their email has been received - this will be implemented in future releases as the user alreday gets a pop up informing them that the email has successfully been sent - this will be implemented in future releases.
